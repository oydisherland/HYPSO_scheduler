The campain_planner file takes in an "input_file" this file cointains the different captures in the schedule. 
If this file could provide functionality to take the plan schedule.cvs file that is produce by my algorithm and reformat the data, 
so that it is similar to that of input_file, this function could be used to create a file that can be given to campain planner. 

Further todos:
- Extend the data processing time to 7 minutes after each capture. (double check that this is correct)
- Check if the stabalization of the star stracker is important to consider and include a buffer before capturing?
- Get hypso 2 TLE
